    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p1>A blood donation occurs when a person voluntarily has blood drawn and used for transfusions.
        and/or made into biopharmaceutical medications by a process called fractionation (separation of whole blood components). 
        Donation may be of whole blood, or of specific components directly (apheresis).
         Blood banks often participate in the collection process as well as the procedures that follow it.

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>Charles Richard Drew (1904â€“1950) was an American surgeon and medical researcher.
         He researched in the field of blood transfusions, developing improved techniques for blood storage, and applied his expert knowledge to developing large-scale blood banks early in World War II.
          This allowed medics to save thousands of lives of the Allied forces. As the most prominent African American in the field, Drew protested against the practice of racial segregation in the donation of blood,
           as it lacked scientific foundation, and resigned his position with the American Red Cross, which maintained the policy until 1950.[
